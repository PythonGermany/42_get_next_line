0|The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
1|It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.
2|The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
3|
4|The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.
5|Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
6|Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

8|The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V).
9|As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is actually white).
10|It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][22] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud.
11|Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
12|The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
13|
14|Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy.
15|This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.
16|When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, 
17|its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant.
18|It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, 
19|and render Earth uninhabitable â€“ but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, 
20|and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.
21|
22|The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times.
23|The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of some solar calendars.
24|The predominant calendar in use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based upon the standard 16th-century interpretation of the Sun's observed movement as actual movement.
